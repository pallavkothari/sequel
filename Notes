Pseudocode that ought to be implemented in the selectExpression visitor hook.

For each selectExpressionItem, do:
    Feed gson document into elasticsearch, containing (for now):
        - filename
        - node's text contents
            - expression
            - alias
        - node's type (selectExpressionItem)

- A way of feeding json documents into local elasticsearch
- A way of searching!
